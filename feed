										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It is a perennial question pondered by the preacher &#8212; how long should my sermon be?&nbsp;Recently a friend took an informal poll on Twitter, asking, &#8220;How long do you normally preach?&#8221; The answers varied, as one might expect, and some discussion ensued as to what the &#8220;best length&#8221; for a sermon might be. Is there such a thing?</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll offer my opinion on that at the end of this post, but in general, I agree with the dictum that the best sermons can&#8217;t be too long and the worst sermons can&#8217;t be too short. But all things being equal, I do think there&#8217;s such a thing as a sermon that&#8217;s too long and a sermon that&#8217;s too short. Here I suggest five reasons for each error. Firstly:</p>



<p><strong>Your sermons shouldn’t be too short, because . . .</strong></p>



<h4><strong><em>1. Sunday is often the only Bible your people get each week.</em></strong></h4>



<p>It&#8217;s sad, but it&#8217;s true. It shouldn&#8217;t be the case, but it often is. The most Bible many (most?) of your people will get each week will be in the Sunday morning worship time. All the more reason not to short-shrift your sermon time. Your people need deep Bible.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><em><strong>2. The word of God is worthy of sustained attention, not drive-by sampling.</strong></em></h4>



<p>Too-short sermons treat the Scriptures like a shallow reservoir for tasting, not a deep well for eternal sustenance. Don&#8217;t treat the Bible in your services like a Bartlett&#8217;s Book of Quotations or a spiritual buffet for personal improvement, and don&#8217;t treat the sermon like a half-time speech or a motivational TED talk. The word of God is worthy of our attention, of all our efforts to&nbsp;<em>dwell</em>&nbsp;in it. Short-shrifting the sermon communicates to people that the Bible—and thus God&#8217;s glory—is not worth gazing at. Train your flock through your preaching to&nbsp;<em>behold</em>.</p>



<h4><em><strong>3. Hearing from God should have the most prominent place in the gathering.</strong></em></h4>



<p>Sometimes we short-shrift the sermon out of service time constraints, but then it is easy to get priorities out of whack. Consider this: it is more important for us to hear from God than it is for God to hear from us. Both are necessary, of course! But if your creative elements outweigh the preaching in a service, things are out of whack. Even our worship in singing, which is vitally important for congregational encouragement and a reflection of God&#8217;s worth, is not as important as hearing from God&#8217;s word. God deserves our words, but he can live without them. We, on the other hand, cannot live without a word from God. Teach your people to weigh hearing from God as more glorious than our self-expression.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Heresies never really go away, do they? They just get repackaged, repurposed, and recycled for every generation. And the Church must always stay on guard]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Heresies never really go away, do they? They just get repackaged, repurposed, and recycled for every generation. And the Church must always stay on guard, always ready to defend the faith once delivered against new affronts by old ideas.</p>



<p>Around Christmas time each year, for instance, we get to see the new variations on the historical understanding of the birth of Christ (just as every Easter we get to re-experience&nbsp;the annual attacks on the historicity of the resurrection). Just last week, I responded to this question by someone on Twitter: &#8220;If you&#8217;re a Christian, do you believe in the virgin birth?&#8221;</p>



<p>I replied that the question itself would have been viewed as odd by our theological forefathers. The virgin birth is one of the cornerstones of Christian belief. Without it, you don&#8217;t have Christianity. The original questioner accused me of &#8220;gatekeeping.&#8221; She said, &#8220;You don&#8217;t get to decide who&#8217;s in and who&#8217;s out.&#8221; And she&#8217;s right. I don&#8217;t. We don&#8217;t make orthodoxy. As Chesterton said, &#8220;It is making us!&#8221;</p>



<p>So you and I have the option, of course, of believing or disbelieving in the virgin birth. But if we disbelieve, we don&#8217;t get to call our tailor-made theology &#8220;Christianity.&#8221; Orthodoxy is not a buffet. The virgin birth is an essential tenet of Christianity &#8212; a first-order doctrine &#8212; and here is why:</p>



<p><strong>The Scriptures are not ambiguous about Christ&#8217;s birth.</strong></p>



<p>Sometimes we hear theologians say the &#8220;virgin&#8221; referred to in Isaiah&#8217;s messianic prophecy (7:14) is simply a &#8220;young woman of marriage-able age.&#8221; The word of course does include that semantic possibility, but in the light of the new covenant, we see with a lot more clarity what &#8220;kind&#8221; of virgin the Christ child is born to &#8212; not simply a young woman of marriage-able age, but a woman who had never experienced sexual intercourse.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Now the birth of&nbsp;Jesus Christ&nbsp;took place in this way.&nbsp;When his mother Mary had been betrothed&nbsp;to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child&nbsp;from the Holy Spirit.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><cite><strong>Matthew 1:18</strong></cite></blockquote>



<p>&#8220;Before they came together&#8221; is a reference to sexual intercourse. Before Joseph and Mary had been married or engaged in any procreative activity, she was found to be with child. And if that reference isn&#8217;t clear enough, Matthew tells us that the child is &#8220;from the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Then, in verse 25, Matthew mentions that Joseph did not &#8220;know&#8221; Mary (in the sexual sense) until after she&#8217;d given birth to this son.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I know the usual reasoning in favor of dogs: cats are vicious, little tyrants while dogs are loyal friends. I’ve even heard people say that dogs love unconditionally. I agree with this reasoning]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I know the usual reasoning in favor of dogs: cats are vicious, little tyrants while dogs are loyal friends. I’ve even heard people say that dogs love unconditionally. I agree with this reasoning. Really, I do—and still prefer cats.</p>



<p>Cat-people versus dog-people. What does this light-hearted divide among us have to do with Jesus? Well, literally nothing; but if you’ll indulge in a little silliness, then something serious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Without the slightest hint of exaggeration, here’s why I agree with the argument for dogs but don’t want one. I don’t want a canine<em>&nbsp;because</em>&nbsp;they are unceasing lovers. The burden of a thousand kisses is too much to bear. I don’t want to give up my time and energy to enjoy what insistently enjoys me. You ask, doesn’t such an affection feel good? It feels dangerously good. A love that fierce will compel me outside on a bitter, below-zero night for doggie duty. It tolerates the sharp barks that stab the ear canals at every passing ambulance or mailman. Bring on the indifferent cats, please.</p>



<p>In other words, unconditional love is demanding. It’s true of a dog, and—more seriously—it’s true of God. Don’t be ridiculous; I’m not suggesting that God is our pet. But tell me that the love of God doesn’t require sacrifice. Tell me that God’s love doesn’t demand the willingness to lose everything and, in fact, does take quite a lot. Yes, the gift of freedom will take freedom from you.</p>



<p>Of course, we must admit that any “freedoms” given up to enjoy a pet will never rise beyond inconveniences. The love of Jesus is severe. It severs us from wicked pleasures and privileges; from any authority to determine right or wrong for ourselves; from worldly comforts; from any braggadocio or self-vindication; and, for some, from any more breath in the lungs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 1943, C. S. Lewis gave three lectures in Durham later published in one volume as&nbsp;The Abolition of Man.&nbsp;The first of these lectures he titled “Men Without Chests,” aimed as a critique of a recent volume that argued for the subjective nature of meaning in a book for school children.The authors of that book, Lewis summarized, likely were attempting to “fortify the minds of young people against emotion.”</p>



<p>However, Lewis countered, the challenge of the day for young people is not restraining or starving them of emotion, but rather awakening it and directing it toward what is just and true. The authors of the children’s book, Lewis concludes, are trying to build the intellect, but carve out the heart. In the end, what they create are men with minds but no heart. Men with intellect, but without chests, and yet we “expect of them virtue and enterprise.” Herein Lewis posits his corrective, “The task of the modern educator is not to cut down jungles but to irrigate deserts.”</p>



<p>For the theological educator, the task is no different. In the twenty-first century there are jungles of competing worldviews, arguments, and approaches to theological education. In as much as the theological educator attempts only to cut these down as an intellectual exercise apart from understanding how theological instruction is a matter of the heart, he is only cutting that which will grow back. The question to ask, rather, is how should the theological educator irrigate the dry hearts of his students and stir their affections to that which is just and true?</p>



<p>In a recent article published in&nbsp;Permanent Things, I give a long-form presentation on the two ways I think theological educators can answer this question: that is by serving as shepherds and sherpas. What follows is the second half of that essay.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Christ is the head of the church. And he does not have out-of-body experiences. To submit to the authority of Jesus Christ over your life is to live in fellowship with the church.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Christ is the head of the church. And he does not have out-of-body experiences. To submit to the authority of Jesus Christ over your life is to live in fellowship with the church.</p>



<h3>Here are nine reasons why you should have a high view of the church…</h3>



<p><strong>Faith in God is practiced in spiritual community.&nbsp;</strong>The unbelieving society we live in regularly claims that faith is a private matter. But this is not the truth. Indeed, faith is a personal matter. As Jesus told Nicodemus, “You must be born again” (John 3:7). But personal faith is not private faith. True faith is lived in spiritual community with others. In the Old Testament, the faith community was the nation of Israel. In the New Testament, it is the church, a new community in Christ that transcends gender, race, or status (Galatians 3:28). To live in faith in Christ is to live in fellowship with the church.</p>



<p><strong>The church is the household of God.&nbsp;</strong>Writing to Timothy in Ephesus, Paul called the church “the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar and buttress of the truth” (1 Timothy 3:15). In salvation, we are born again and adopted into the family of God. But a newborn child needs to become a part of a household for nourishment, fellowship, and protection. The church is the household of faith (Galatians 6:10). More than that, it is God’s household. To reject the church is to reject the means of care the Lord has provided for his redeemed children.</p>



<p><strong>Church membership brings assurance of salvation.</strong>&nbsp;A Christian is one who has professed saving-faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. But that personal profession must be made to and among the church for there to be true assurance. In the New Testament letters, the two essential marks of true conversion are faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and love for all the saints. Christian fellowship is as essential to true assurance as personal faith. Love for the saints demonstrates faith in Christ. “We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers,” wrote the Apostle John, “whoever does not love abides in death” (1 John 3:14).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We&#8217;re pleased to announce today&#8217;s release of The Gospel According to Satan: Eight Lies About God that Sound Like the Truth by Midwestern Seminary&#8217;s author in residence, Jared C. Wilson.</p>



<p>In this new book from Thomas Nelson, Wilson explores the reality that not every lie sounds untrue. Some, in fact, sound right to our ears. And some are repeated so often that they virtually become &#8220;common knowledge.&#8221; This is what makes lies about God so dangerous. So we have to ask, what might God&#8217;s enemy want us to believe to lead us astray? And would we even see it happening?</p>



<p> Wilson, also an assistant professor of pastoral ministry at Spurgeon College, brings us this compelling and enlightening exploration of the popular and oftentimes pleasing ways spiritual darkness masquerades as light. With sharp insight, warm humor, and a shepherd&#8217;s heart, he examines eight lines popular with too many Christians &#8212; eight lies the enemy wants us to believe &#8212; and provides eight lines of counterattack to help us regain our footing.</p>



<p>“Enumerates the major ways the Devil uses his cunning and calculating ways of luring us off the narrow road of God’s grace. We will all do well to read this book and confront the lies we are being sold.” </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In evangelism, we have a very specific bull’s-eye to our aim: we want to persuade people to become followers of Jesus. We want them to convert. But Paul says we persuade others to follow Jesus (2 Cor. 5:11). I find the word persuade helpful, as it guards us from error: we persuade, but we do not manipulate; we persuade, but we are not the ones who bring about repentance or conversion. Of course, we long to see people converted because we understand that conversion is required for them to become Christians. But true conversion is the work of the Holy Spirit.</p>



<p>Conversion is the point of Christian faith that is most often misunderstood. It’s also a word that’s not particularly in favor with the modern world. No surprise. It was confusing when Jesus taught it to a religious leader of his day (John 3), and it is confusing to Christians and non-Christians today. So it’s good to spend some time explaining it.</p>



<p>In the Muslim context where I live, many people from other faith backgrounds find it disorienting to hear me preach that no one is born a Christian, that all Christians are converts. Even those from Christian backgrounds are confused about conversion, because many come from traditions that emphasize that a person is a Christian because of external reasons. But the Bible clearly teaches that conversion is not a function of your parents’ religion, of which church you join, or of what your passport says. It’s not based on your academic achievements, even if they are from a religious institution. Conversion comes from true, conscious, genuine faith in Jesus.</p>



<p>But just as we cannot produce conversion, neither can we produce genuine faith. This also is the Holy Spirit’s territory.</p>

<p>It is a perennial question pondered by the preacher &#8212; how long should my sermon be?&nbsp;Recently a friend took an informal poll on Twitter, asking, &#8220;How long do you normally preach?&#8221; The answers varied, as one might expect, and some discussion ensued as to what the &#8220;best length&#8221; for a sermon might be. Is there such a thing?</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll offer my opinion on that at the end of this post, but in general, I agree with the dictum that the best sermons can&#8217;t be too long and the worst sermons can&#8217;t be too short. But all things being equal, I do think there&#8217;s such a thing as a sermon that&#8217;s too long and a sermon that&#8217;s too short. Here I suggest five reasons for each error. Firstly:</p>



<p><strong>Your sermons shouldn’t be too short, because . . .</strong></p>



<h4><strong><em>1. Sunday is often the only Bible your people get each week.</em></strong></h4>



<p>It&#8217;s sad, but it&#8217;s true. It shouldn&#8217;t be the case, but it often is. The most Bible many (most?) of your people will get each week will be in the Sunday morning worship time. All the more reason not to short-shrift your sermon time. Your people need deep Bible.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><em><strong>2. The word of God is worthy of sustained attention, not drive-by sampling.</strong></em></h4>



<p>Too-short sermons treat the Scriptures like a shallow reservoir for tasting, not a deep well for eternal sustenance. Don&#8217;t treat the Bible in your services like a Bartlett&#8217;s Book of Quotations or a spiritual buffet for personal improvement, and don&#8217;t treat the sermon like a half-time speech or a motivational TED talk. The word of God is worthy of our attention, of all our efforts to&nbsp;<em>dwell</em>&nbsp;in it. Short-shrifting the sermon communicates to people that the Bible—and thus God&#8217;s glory—is not worth gazing at. Train your flock through your preaching to&nbsp;<em>behold</em>.</p>



<h4><em><strong>3. Hearing from God should have the most prominent place in the gathering.</strong></em></h4>



<p>Sometimes we short-shrift the sermon out of service time constraints, but then it is easy to get priorities out of whack. Consider this: it is more important for us to hear from God than it is for God to hear from us. Both are necessary, of course! But if your creative elements outweigh the preaching in a service, things are out of whack. Even our worship in singing, which is vitally important for congregational encouragement and a reflection of God&#8217;s worth, is not as important as hearing from God&#8217;s word. God deserves our words, but he can live without them. We, on the other hand, cannot live without a word from God. Teach your people to weigh hearing from God as more glorious than our self-expression.</p>

<p>The stranger didn’t know I just watched my brother die.&nbsp;&nbsp;I stepped into the elevator to the neurology critical care unit for the last time. Beside me stood a tall, older man. For a moment, we locked eyes and I recognized in him what I felt in myself—a heavy heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“God be with you,” he said as he walked onto the fourth floor—respiratory ICU.&nbsp; “And with you,” I replied, seconds before the elevator doors shut.&nbsp; In the final hours of Barry’s life, I shared the gospel with him (again), prayed for him and held his hand as he entered eternity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Initially, he went for a routine surgical procedure. Instead, he endured four heart attacks and he coded four times. The doctors successfully resuscitated him. But he lost fourteen minutes of oxygen. Several days later, he suffered a debilitating stroke. After an agonizing month of medical ups and downs, he passed away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sibling relationships can often be complicated. Ours was more so than most. Barry had not spoken with me or my other siblings in a few years. In his last weeks, we experienced incredible joy as we reconnected with him and he with us. But what is lost intensifies the grief.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This isn’t how God created the world to be,” I heard myself say to him at his deathbed. Yet here we were.&nbsp;The truth is these circumstances force me to a universal reality: We are all surrounded by brokenness, pain, sin, and death.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“The people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light, and for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death, on them a light has dawned.”</em>&nbsp;</p><cite>Matthew 4:16&nbsp;</cite></blockquote>



<p>God came to us. He came in poverty, in lowliness, not splendor. He came as Immanuel, “God with us” to deliver His people from their sins. Yet, this phrase “God with us” is wrapped in mystery.&nbsp;</p>

SUMMARY:Heaven in Business: Sacred Work
DESCRIPTION:The world is on the verge of a spiritual awakening and it is not confined to the four walls of the church. Work is the greatest place to develop and forge our friendship with God. When God partners with us in all that we do\, then there is no such thing as a “normal day“. We believe that your work is significant because of the ONE who called you to it. You don’t need to be a preacher in the pulpit in order to advance God’s Kingdom. Your work\, is your ministry. We’ve created a worldwide community of Believers who know their calling is to the business realm. Thousands of lives have been touched & transformed\, and those numbers grow each day. \n\n\n\n When you realize your work is sacred and experience how much God wants to partner with you\, hopelessness and insignificance become a thing of the past. Your vision for life will be supercharged with possibility. Join us at the Sacred Work Conference and leave with renewed vision\, increased significance\, and a deepened friendship with God.

SUMMARY:Definitions: Gospel and Persuade
DESCRIPTION:Conversion is the point of Christian faith that is most often misunderstood. It’s also a word that’s not particularly in favor of the modern world. No surprise. It was confusing when Jesus taught it to a religious leader of his day (John 3)\, and it is confusing to Christians and non-Christians today. So it’s good to spend some time explaining it.In the Muslim context where I live\, many people from other faith backgrounds find it disorienting to hear me preach that no one is born a Christian\, that all Christians are converting. Even those from Christian backgrounds are confused about conversion because many come from traditions that emphasize that a person is a Christian because of external reasons. But the Bible clearly teaches that conversion is not a function of your parents’ religion\, of which church you join\, or of what your passport says. It’s not based on your academic achievements\, even if they are from a religious institution. Conversion comes from true\, conscious\, genuine faith in Jesus.
